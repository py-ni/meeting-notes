Initial meeting at EuroPython 2025

- Antonio: we need debug mode to enforce the contract
- Petr: do we need new API and new ABI? Can we start with new API
	- Anto/GraalPy: without ABI, debug mode would need recompilation
- Petr: incremental change: API with context, but not vtable yet
- Petr: Grand unified object model should be in the vision document (perhaps listed as followup step)
- Petr: ergonomic API is not the main goal

- context argument
	- module functions: simple
	- slots: where to put the new function pointers in PyTypeObject
	    - do we want to keep all the slots in the new API
	- Steve Dower's C API revolution idea can be useful for API between extensions (NumPy API)

- local vs global references
- naming? PyNI_GetItem, PyNI_Ref, PyNI_Local?
- Moving GC support:
	- David Woods: can we have callback to move object's memory (C++ objects cannot be just moved by the GC)
	- Idea: flag for types: pin my memory (I don't support moving GC), off by default
- GetMainInterpreterContext -> we can make it work with vtable: extension asks for a pointer to a function that returns the context
	- there should be function that "closes" the context

Conclusion:
	- setup a monthly meeting again
	- create vision PEP that will list individual self-contained steps that will be implementation PEPs
		- GraalPy devs can create an initial draft
	- Ken may look into creating an example in CPython that would show how extension using
	the new API with handles does not compromise the performance of a for-loop with unboxed integer
