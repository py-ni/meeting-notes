- Pierre shared edits to the PEP on Discord: https://gist.github.com/paugier/bf9510c81a04b66506cf064868f42ad3
- We discussed PyInterface prototype: https://github.com/zooba/cpython/pull/44
- Ken showed the demos from CPyhon core sprint
- Discussion about using C header vs Python for specification of the API
    - conclusion: we need more metadata than just plain C types, so it won't be plain C header anyway and so we may as well be just Python
    - saves dependency on pycparser
    - this sparked discussion about 3rd party deps in CPython policies
    - HPy depends on `pycparser` and `attrs`, but we would have to ask Antonio from 2019 to find out why
        => we probably won't need any 3rd party deps anyway
- Action items:
    - Stepan will merge all the versions of the PEP we have and setup a GitHub repo with final PEP source
    - we will continue editing/polishing the PEP through PRs
