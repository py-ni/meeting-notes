- PEP
  - Motivation ok
  - Architecture is missing the new error handling (re @Mark)
  - Approach: incremental implementation, start with header based around
    PyModExport, first extensions, extend API from there to cover surface
- Issue about PyList_GET_ITEM => PyNI_List_GetItem
  - broken in free-threading
  - borrowed reference is not allowed in PyNI
  - we must avoid crashing: so, strong reference and overflow check, but
    nothing else
- PyNI Universal ABI and consequence for NumPy
  - it's possible to convert to/from PyObject* but use no other Py* API and
    produce universal wheels -> into the PEP
  - PetrV: it's already beneficial to partially migrate, because the PyNI API
    gives you faster speed to talk to the interpreter (tagged ints etc); then
    you dont get universal wheels, but that helps performance on any optimizing
    interpreter
- Wider ecosystem (backwards compat) issue
  - we should not provide an ABI-level backwards compatibility extension, but
    just a header like python-capi-compat
- Error handling
  - function return RefOrError, and that needs to be checked/unpacked (inline
    function) similar to rust, and we just reserve 0=error and
    1=no-result-but-no-error, but those constants are not specified and a
    platform-specific implementation detail
- ABI
  - existing build tools should initially be used to tag PyNI universal as
    stable abi
  - new tag TBD
  - non-universal PyNI builds TBD
